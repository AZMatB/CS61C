Problem 1

a:11010100100111000000000000000000

b:65536

c:2^-40

d:0 (in term of decimal and not subtracted for bias)

e:31 (in term of decimal and not subtracted for bias)

Problem 2

a:Multiple files are to be merged into one excutable and the address of the
instructions of the combined file is undetermined until the object files are
ready to be linked together.

b:No, the objective file have placeholders for the corresponding absolute
address of other files. As long as the linking stage is not excuted, those
placeholders are not filled. So, only the file changed needs recompiling and
assembling.

c i:symbol table

  ii:relocation table

  iii:symbol table and relocation table

Problem 3

a:0.02

b:B is faster. By 59.091 percent.

c i: 0.02 (Composition of two levels by product)

  ii: 4 (Plug in HP_1 by calculating AMAT form L2)

  iii: 11 (Without calculating L2)

d: 6.62 (CPI base + (1*0.04(for I$)+.4*0.06(for D$))*80)

Problem 4

a i:10 (3 for index and 3 for offset)

  ii:Share address with bytes that have  addresses: 0xABC8, 0xABC9, 0xABCA,
  0xABCB, 0xABCC, 0xABCE, and 0xABCF. 

  iii:All bytes that have index bits 001 at 4-6 bits counting from right and different tag bits will gurantee to have a cache miss. 

b i:11 (2 for index and 3 for offset) 

  ii: Share address with bytes that have  addresses: 0xABC8, 0xABC9, 0xABCA,
  0xABCB, 0xABCC, 0xABCE, and 0xABCF.  

  iii: No such access exists.

c i:Max is 70% and min is 70%.  

  ii: Max is 60% and min is 60%    

  iii: Max is 0% and min is 0%
